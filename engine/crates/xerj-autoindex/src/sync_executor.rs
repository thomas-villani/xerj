/// Issue #482 regression guard.
///
/// The durable-snapshot path (`--no-graph`) fsyncs four directories per seal
/// plus two per GC step. `File::open` applied to a *directory* is a Unix-only
/// idiom: on Windows it returns `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` (os error 5) for every
/// call, because `std` cannot pass `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS`. Each of
/// those sites was therefore an unconditional abort of the whole run on that
/// platform. The engine had already learned this once —
/// `xerj_common::fsio::fsync_dir` carries the `#[cfg(windows)]` shim and the
/// write-up — and this module re-derived the broken form anyway.
///
/// The fix is `#[cfg(windows)]`-shaped, so no behavioural test compiled for
/// Unix can tell fixed code from unfixed. The behavioural coverage is the
/// windows-latest `autoindex-fd-smoke` job, which since this change runs the
/// reported `--no-graph` flow. This guard is what keeps the idiom from coming
/// back on the platform the unit suite is never compiled for.
